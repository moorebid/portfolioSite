# portfolioSite

I've got some free time this holiday season, and thought shoot better build a portfolio site.  
You can check it out here: [moorebid.com](https://www.moorebid.com), the URL is https://www.moorebid.com

I'll update this as I move along.

Set up the basic structure of the site. Going to use html5, sass or scss, css, jquery, ajax, php, and mySQL.  
Would prefer PostgreSQL but it's not offered through my hosting plan :(
